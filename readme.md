## Camera skill
In principle this should be a skill that allows the Mycroft Home AI to take a photo on command. How successful we are in making that happen remains to be seen...


## Description
Take pictures with webcam. That's all. It'll overwrite the previous picture, at least for now. Why? Because I've not decided what to do with the resultant image yet.

## What do I say?

* "Take a picture"
* "Selfie, please!"

(Take a look in the vocab file for specifics)
